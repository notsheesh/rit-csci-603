Test Case 1
Checks how well the simulation handles multiple cows and paintballs in the field. 
Tests the ability of the program to consider various interactions between different cows and paintballs.
Features:
Multiple cows with varying distances from each other.
Multiple paintballs with different radii and positions.
Each paintball should have interactions with multiple cows.

Test Case 2
Assesses the program's ability to handle a more complex and interconnected layout of cows and paintballs. 
Evaluates how well the simulation captures interactions among different elements in the field.
Features:
Cows and paintballs placed in a more intricate arrangement.
Paintballs triggering each other in addition to interacting with cows.
Different distances and radii for a diverse set of interactions.
Challenging Arrangement:

Test Case 3 
Assesses the simulation's ability to correctly identify scenarios where no cow is painted by any starting paintball. 
The arrangement of cows and paintballs is strategically set up to ensure that no paintball reaches any cow, challenging the program to recognize and handle situations where no paint splashes on the cows.
Features:
Cows and paintballs are positioned in a way that avoids any direct interaction.
The goal is to evaluate the simulation's ability to distinguish scenarios where no cow is affected by the starting paintballs.
