Test Case 1
Triggering any paintball will result in a cascading effect where each paintball 
triggers the next one in the sequence. 
Outcome - 
Due to the specific configuration of the paintballs and cows, this cascading 
triggering will not lead to any cows being affected.

Test Case 2
Triggering any paintball will trigger all others at once due to the large blast radius.
Outcome - 
All cows*** will be affected by all paintballs so triggering any ball is the same as triggering others.
***Exception: Etloo, added to demonstrate that one cow can still deviate from the norm if its far enough
to evade the large blast radius of paintballs
All options are equally optimal as others.

Test Case 3

Triggering no paintball neither triggers any other paintball nor does it paint any other cow for that matter. 
Outcome - 
No cow is painted at all. 
No cascading takes place.

Test Case 4

Triggering each paintball only captures one cow at max. 
No cascading takes place at all. 
Also stress testing with floating location indices and radius.
Outcome - 
Each cow is painted by only one color
No cascading takes place. 
All options are equally optimal as others.
