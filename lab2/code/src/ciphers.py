CSCI-603 Lab 2: Ciphers

A program that encodes/decodes a message by applying a set of transformation operations.
The transformation operations are:
    shift - Sa[,n] changes letter at index a by moving it n letters fwd in the alphabet. A negative
        value for n shifts the letter backward in the alphabet.
    rotate - R[n] rotates the string n positions to the right. A negative value for n rotates the string
        to the left.
    duplicate - Da[,n] follows character at index a with n copies of itself.
    trade - Ta,b swap the places of the a-th and b-th characters.
    affine - Aa,b applies the affine cipher algorithm y = (ax + b) mod 26 using a and b as keys.

All indices numbers (the subscript parameters) are 0-based.
